<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Everything you neeed to know about computers</h1>
<br>
<h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Mother board</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;">Motherboard, also known as mainboard, is the computer's main circuit board. It's a
thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive and optical drives, expansion cards to
control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB
ports). The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every single part of the 
computer.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 40px;">CPU(Central processing unit)</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;">The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the]
computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer,
and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or
start an application, you're sending instructions to the CPU.The CPU is usually a
two-inch ceramic square with a silicon chip located inside. The chip is usually about 
the size of a thumbnail. The CPU fits into the motherboard's CPU socket, which is 
covered by the heat sink, an object that absorbs heat from the CPU.A processor's speed
is measured in megahertz (MHz), or millions of instructions per second; and gigahertz
(GHz), or billions of instructions per second. A faster processor can execute
instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the computer depends on the
speed of many different components not just the processor. A cpu is usually followed by
a the cpu cooler wich helps the processor by cooling it down so it doesn't get too hot
and slows down its performance

<h2 style="font-size:40px;">RAM(Radnom Acess Memory)</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;">RAM is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations,
it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed.This short-term memory
disappears when the computer is turned off. If you're working on a document,
spreadsheet, or other type of file, you'll need to save it to avoid losing it. When
you save a file, the data is written to the hard drive, which acts as long-term
storage. RAM is measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). The more RAM you have,
the more things your computer can do at the same time. If you don't have enough RAM,
you may notice that your computer is sluggish when you have several programs open.
Because of this, many people add extra RAM to their computers to improve performance.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Hard Drive</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;">The hard drive is where your software, documents, and other files are stored. The hard 
drive is long-term storage, which means the data is still saved even if you turn the
computer off or unplug it. When you run a program or open a file, the computer copies
some of the data from the hard drive onto the RAM. When you save a file, the data is
copied back to the hard drive. The faster the hard drive, the faster your computer can
start up and load programs.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:40px;">Power Supply</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;"> The power supply unit in a computer converts the power from the wall outlet to the type
of power needed by the computer. It sends power through cables to the motherboard and
other components.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size:40px;"><b>Most computers have expansion slots on the motherboard that allow you to add various
types of expansion cards. These are sometimes called PCI (peripheral component
interconnect) cards. You may never need to add any PCI cards because most motherboards
have built-in video, sound, network, and other capabilities. However, if you want to
boost the performance of your computer or update the capabilities of an older computer,
you can always add one or more cards. Below are some of the most common types of
expansion cards:</b></p>

<h2 style="font-size:40px;">Video Card</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;">The video card is responsible for what you see on the monitor. Most computers have a
GPU (graphics processing unit) built into the motherboard instead of having a separate
video card. If you like playing graphics-intensive games, you can add a faster video
card to one of the expansion slots to get better performance.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:40px;">Sound Card</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;">The sound card—also called an audio card—is responsible for what you hear in the
speakers or headphones. Most motherboards have integrated sound, but you can upgrade
to a dedicated sound card for higher-quality sound.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:40px;">Network Card</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;">The network card allows your computer to communicate over a network and access the
Internet. It can either connect with an Ethernet cable or through a wireless
connection (often called Wi-Fi). Many motherboards have built-in network connections,
and a network card can also be added to an expansion slot.</p>
